## About Me

I just needed a place to post random stuff I come up with. Therefor this humble blog.
I am a Norwegian telco/wireless engineer who have been working over a decade as a penetration tester. On my spare time I do security research, and collect stuff like cipher machines, mechanical calculators and antique knives.
